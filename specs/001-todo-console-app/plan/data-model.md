# Data Model: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

## Task Entity

### Fields
- **id**: int
  - Auto-incremented, unique identifier
  - Positive integer
  - Required for all operations
  - Generated automatically by TaskManager

- **title**: str
  - Required field
  - Non-empty after stripping whitespace
  - User-provided task name/description in brief
  - Maximum length: not specified (allow reasonable length)

- **description**: str
  - Optional field
  - Default value: empty string ("")
  - User-provided detailed task information
  - Maximum length: not specified (allow reasonable length)

- **completed**: bool
  - Task completion status
  - Default value: False
  - Can be toggled between True/False states
  - Represents whether task has been completed

- **created_at**: datetime
  - UTC timestamp when task is created
  - Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
  - Automatically set when task is added
  - Immutable after creation

### Validation Rules
1. **Title Validation**: Title must be non-empty after stripping leading/trailing whitespace
   - Input: "   " → Rejected
   - Input: "" → Rejected
   - Input: "Task Title" → Accepted
   - Input: "   Task Title   " → Accepted (stripped to "Task Title")

2. **ID Uniqueness**: Each task must have a unique ID within the collection
   - Auto-generated by TaskManager
   - Sequential incrementing from 1
   - No duplicates allowed

3. **ID Validity**: ID must be a positive integer
   - Input: 0 or negative → Rejected
   - Input: non-integer → Rejected
   - Input: positive integer → Accepted (if unique)

4. **Field Type Validation**: All fields must match their expected types
   - id: int
   - title: str
   - description: str
   - completed: bool
   - created_at: datetime

### State Transitions
- **completed** field can transition:
  - False → True (when marking complete)
  - True → False (when marking incomplete)
- All other fields are immutable after creation except through update operations

### Relationships
- Task entities exist independently
- All tasks are managed within a single TaskManager instance
- No direct relationships between individual Task entities

## Task List Entity

### Fields
- **tasks**: list[Task]
  - Collection of all Task entities
  - Maintained in creation order (oldest first)
  - Private attribute of TaskManager class
  - Supports CRUD operations

### Behavior
- Maintains insertion order
- Supports indexed access
- Supports iteration
- Supports addition, removal, and modification operations
